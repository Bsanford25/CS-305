# CS-305
The client for this project is Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company looking to modernize and update security for their existing web app. I feel as though I did a good job interpreting the clientâ€™s needs and identifying vulnerabilities in their software. In addition, I also made recommendations on how to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Integrating the Maven dependency check was challenging at first, but I was able to understand it once it was successfully implemented. Understanding how to spot false positives and then suppress them was a valuable skill to learn. Most vulnerabilities in this case were caused by the use of old or outdated libraries, so updating those typically would help mitigate the risks. Pen testing in the future is also a great way to continue to ensure that software is secure. Resources included in the modules were very helpful as were forums such as Stack Overflow for when I got stuck on something.
